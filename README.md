## libft project
In this project I built a library of useful and necessary functions that were used and will be used in future projects. 
These functions replicate the ones in the standard library, just written from scratch.
By developing this library, I gained a thorough understanding of data structures and algorithms.

### Compiling

Run the following commands:

* To compile
	- `make`
* To remove objects:
	- `make clean`
* To remove objects and binary file (program):
	- `make fclean`
* To re-compile:
	- `make re`
